### Idea:
Find the minimum and maximum values of an array, then calculate the sum of the array. The sum of the four smallest elements will be equal to the sum of the array minus the minimum value, and vice versa.

### Run code:

```
node minMaxSum.js
```
User enters input as instructed and presses enter.
